  "description": "My name is Alvaro Zorn, I'm 26 years old and I was born in Hamburg. I had the desire to go into computer science from a very early age. This desire has now solidified and my enthusiasm grows from year to year. My passion is Java development, but I prefer to call myself a generalist. That's why I'm happy to accept any challenge.",
